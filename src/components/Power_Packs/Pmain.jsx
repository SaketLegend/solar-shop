Power failures on the utility grid do not affect off-grid solar systems. On the flip side, batteries can only store a certain amount of energy, and during cloudy times, being connected to the grid is actually where the security is.

Responsible, sustainable businesses are discovering that the bottom-line is not just about people and profits anymore. It is also about the planet. Solar energy's reduced operating costs, good return on investments and negligible maintenance have a very positive impact on the bottom-line and greater impact on the environment. Demonstrating environmental leadership pays great dividends.
